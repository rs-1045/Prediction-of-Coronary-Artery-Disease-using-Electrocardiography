## Prediction-of-Coronary-Artery-Disease-using-Electrocardiography ##

The main objective of this Project is to develop a machine-learning model for the accurate prediction of Coronary artery disease (CAD) using electrocardiography (ECG) data. 


+ Collect and preprocess ECG Data.
+ Develop and train different machine learning models that can accurately classify ECG Data.
+ Evaluate the performance of the model.
+ Compare the performance of the machine learning models.
